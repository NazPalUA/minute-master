TypeScript:
- Prefer types over interfaces
- Use "as const" instead of enums

Naming:
- Directories and files: kebab-case
- Variables and functions: camelCase
- Components: PascalCase with type prefixes (ButtonAccount, CardAnalyticsMain)

Architecture:
- Use functional programming patterns; avoid classes
- If needed to convert some JS type into string, prefer template literals
- Import the "server-only" package in files that are intended exclusively for server-side execution to prevent accidental client-side usage
